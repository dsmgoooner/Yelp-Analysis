In a competitive market like the restaurant industry, understanding the factors that influence business success is crucial for stakeholders. Utilising the Telp dataset, this project aims to investigate the relationship between user engagement(reviews,tips and check-ins) and business success metrics(review count, ratings) for restaurants.
